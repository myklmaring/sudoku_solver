# Sudoku Solver

This project is intended to recieve an image of a sudoku puzzle and return the solved puzzle.  The optical character recognition and the linear programming solver are now integrated.  I will be updating the readme soon to provide a thorough explanation about my methodology as well as how to install/run the program.
